### Project Overview

**Problem Statement**
In Bangladesh, many small shopkeepers lack access to digital tools that would help them reach online customers.

* **Customer Features:**

  * GPS-based shop discovery
  * Product browsing and ordering
  * Cash on delivery support
  * Ability to mark favorites

* **Shopkeeper Features:**

  * Easy store registration with a one-time fee of 100 BDT
  * Product and order management
  * Real-time order notifications
  * Delivery status tracking

* **Trust & Security:**

  * Local-only store discovery
  * Ratings and reviews system
  * Cash on delivery for secure transactions

The system is built on a modular service-based architecture:

* **Client:** React Native Mobile App
* **API Gateway:** Node.js
* **Core Services:**

  * Authentication Service
